# Sales-Data
Portfolio 2:Sales Analysis
I saw this dataset on Kaggle and decided to give it a crack!

Set of Questions given:
- 1.Best Year of Sales? How much was earned that Year?
- 2.Best Month of Sales? How much was earned that month?
- 3.What City had the Highest Sales? How much?
- 4.What Time should they Display Ads to maximise likelihood of Purchase?
- 5.What Product Sold the most? Why?

Probability:
- 6.Probability that next item ordered would be a USB-C Charging Cable?
- 7.Probability that next item ordered would be an iPhone?
- 8.Probability that next item ordered would be a google iPhone?
-9.Probability that next item ordered would be wired headphones?

I decided to use python to clean and analyse my data but then used Tableau to visualise my findings.

Answers:
1.2019 =$34,483,366
2.December= $4,613,443. This could be for multiple reasons including: due to festive season, more gifts are bought, more people got their yearly bonuses etc.
3. San Francisco, $8,262,204.
4. Peak Advertising time would be between 9am to 11 am.
5.AAA Batteries (4 pack), AA Batteries (4 pack), USB-C charging cable, lightning charging cable. These products are cheaper in comparison to other products , which from the graph more of the cheaper costing products sell the most as there is less extended-decision making.
6. USB-C Order = 0.12%
    USB-C Not Order = 0.88%
7. Probability for next people will order iPhone: 0.04%
Probability for next people will not order iPhone: 0.96%
8. Probability for next people will order Google Phone: 0.03%
Probability for next people will not order Google Phone: 0.97%
9.Probability for next people will order Wired Headphones: 0.10%
Probability for next people will not order Wired Headphones: 0.90%
